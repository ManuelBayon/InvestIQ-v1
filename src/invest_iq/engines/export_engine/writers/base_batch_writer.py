    High-level batch writer orchestrating a WriterCore and a Sink.

    Responsibilities
    - Manage the export lifecycle: start() → 0..N write() → commit() → close()
    - Delegate encoding to WriterCore[FormattedT, EncodedT]
    - Delegate persistence to BaseBatchSink[EncodedT]
    - Enforce deterministic state transitions and consistent error handling

    Invariants
    - I/O is performed only by the Sink (the WriterCore encodes only).
    - Public lifecycle methods are final and not overridden by subclasses.
    - Instance is one-shot: after COMMITTED or ERROR, only close() is valid.

    Typical flow
        with writer:
            for item in formatted_items:
                writer.write(item)
            writer.commit()

    Notes
    - `validate` can be provided to enforce schema/consistency per item.
    - Counters (writes_total/errors_total) are maintained for observability.
